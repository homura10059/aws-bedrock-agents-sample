# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AWS Bedrock Agents sample project. The repository is in early development stage with minimal structure currently in place.

## Technology Stack

Based on .gitignore patterns, this project is intended to use:
- Node.js/JavaScript/TypeScript
- AWS Bedrock Agents
- Potentially Next.js, Nuxt.js, or similar frameworks

## Development Commands

- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm run build` - Build TypeScript code 
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm run watch` - Watch mode for development
- `npm run deploy` - Build and deploy to AWS
- `npm run synth` - Build and synthesize CDK templates

**IMPORTANT**: Always run `npm run build` after completing any task to ensure the code compiles without TypeScript errors. This is a critical requirement for maintaining code quality.

## Architecture

The project architecture is not yet established. This section will be updated as the codebase grows and patterns emerge.
